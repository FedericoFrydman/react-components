# Utilities

Several react components that can be used.

## useMedia

This is a react hook that allows a react component to respond to different media query triggers.

## useOutsideClick

This is a react hook that allows a react component to respond to clicks outside its container

## useViewportSize

This is a react hook that allows a react component to respond to different viewport sizes (width and height)

## useLoader

This is a react hook that handles feedback for aynchronous operations. This includes feedback during the operation (spinner), and after the operation (success or
error messages via modals or alerts).

It handles all state management and rendering.

## useForm

This is a react hook that handles the creation and rendering of input fields for inclusion in an HTML form. It need not be used exclusively for all fields in the form.

It handles validation, error processing with input state (focus, blur, etc.), and rendering.

Rendering is done using the ```<FormField><Control/></FormField>``` paradigm in the rest of the framework.

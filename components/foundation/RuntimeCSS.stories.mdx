# Runtime CSS

There are several items in CSS managed by the adonis-design-service that are available and useful in the css.

## var(--dynamic-pad)

Script in the design-service will set a variable called "dynamic-pad" to a variable amount depending on the screen width.
This allows variable spacing as the screen gets smaller. Values are 16, 24, or 32 px depending on the width of the screen.

## body.using-key | body.using-mouse

These are classes applied to the body tag when a mouse is clicked or when a tab is hit.

It allows a control to render focus styling only when keyboard input is being used; highly useful. This can be done for a specific css class for a control (e.g. foo) by
defining its css as:

body.using-key .foo:focus {

}

You can turn off/on the global css in storybook with these commands

<RuntimeCSSTest />

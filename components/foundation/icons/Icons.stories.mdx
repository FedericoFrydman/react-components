# Icons

Icons are are used to indicate function and communicate meaning in the user interface. The new design system icons have been added to the existing `Icon` component and are accessible via the `name` prop.
The previous version icons remain accessible from that component but will be deprecated in the future.

## Sizes

The sizes are `xsmall`, `small`, `medium-small`, `medium`, `large`, and `xlarge`.
You can use shadows to focus attention on a floating action button or indicate that elements are separate from each other.

<br />

## Usage

<br />

```tsx
<Icon name="arrow_right_lg" size="large" useBadge />
```

<Title />

Grid is the foundation blueprint of our layout. It helps us position elements to remain consistent and harmonious across screens.

Our grid is responsive and for the content area only; Header and Sidebar are excluded from the grid. The width of each column is fluid depending on the width of the browser.

**The number of columns, gutters, margin, and padding will change per Breakpoint:**

- **Small:** 4 columns, 16px gutter/margin/padding
- **Medium:** 8 columns, 24px gutter/margin/padding
- **Large:** 12 columns, 32px gutter/margin/padding

**Breakpoints:**
`$grid-breakpoints: ( xs: 0, sm: 320px, md: 640px, lg: 1024px, )`

Content box also is max width at `1680px` without sidebar and `1424px` with `256px` side bar included.

**Dev note: please consider using the [Container Component](path=/docs/layout-container--background-color) inside grid to positioning your components. In this way you are going to avoid extra paddings.**

<Description />

DataTable used TanStack Table framework and written in TypeScript, TanStack Table is headless. This means that it doesn't render any DOM elements, and instead relies on you, the UI/UX developer to provide the table's markup and styles.

## Core Objects and Types

- Column Defs
  - Objects used to configure a column and its data model, display templates, and more
- Table
  - The core table object containing both state and API
- Table Data
  - The core data array you provide the table
- Columns
  - Each column mirrors its respective column def and also provide column-specific APIs
- Rows
  - Each row mirrors its respective row data and provides row-specific APIs
- Header Groups
  - Header groups are computed slices of nested header levels, each containing a group of headers
- Headers
  - Each header is either directly associated with or derived from its column def and provides header-specific APIs
- Cells
  - Each cell mirrors its respective row-column intersection and provides cell-specific APIs

There are even more structures that pertain to specific features like filtering, sorting, grouping, etc, which you can find in the [features](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/features) section.

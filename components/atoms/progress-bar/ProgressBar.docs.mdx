## Usage guideline

- **Do** include proper ARIA tags to ensure Progress Bar is fully accessible for all users, including screen readers.
- Our progress bar can be located anywhere but should be vertically and horizontally centered into space.
- Animated loader bar is used for preloading exclusively.
- Progress bar can be altered by changing the number value in the progressNumber property.
- If a progress bar is triggered by a button, place the progress bar in the button, and disable the button while the progress bar is visible.
- If only a portion of a page is displaying new content or being updated, place the progress bar in that part of the page.
- If you are unsure where to place the progress bar, place it where you want the user's attention to be when loading is finished.
- Only show animated loader bar if the expected wait time is more than a second.

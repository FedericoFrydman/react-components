Multi select cards is a component that is essentially a collective of "card" components in the UX-framework.

<Meta component={MultiSelectCards} title={MultiSelectCards} />

Implements a layout of multiple cards. Upon clicking, the card will render a border with a check mark icon indicating which card 
is selected. A callback is provided to be used to identify which card has been selected. Cards are flexible by changing it's width and height. 

## Usage guideline

- Layout will grow according to the parent's container 
- When width of container is exceeded, cards will wrap instead
- A list of strings and IconNames (Prop: Cards) is the only prop required in order to render component. Icon is optional.
- selectedCards prop is provided to indicated which card has been selected. This will enable border color change and display check mark icon.

## Example code

```tsx
  <Container>
    <MultiSelectCards 
      cards={[
        ['Married', 'ls_prenup'],
        ['Pursue Higher Education', 'ls_balance'],
        ['Own a business', 'ls_access'],
        ['Own a home', 'ls_family'],
        ['Rent a home', 'ls_family'],
        ['Have a will', 'ls_family'],
      ]}
      selectedCards={["Married"]}
      cardWidth="190px"
      cardHeight="100px"
      onCardClick={() => {}}
    />
  </Container>
```

### Result
<Container>
  <MultiSelectCards 
    cards={[
      ['Married', 'ls_prenup'],
      ['Pursue Higher Education', 'ls_balance'],
      ['Own a business', 'ls_access'],
      ['Own a home', 'ls_family'],
      ['Rent a home', 'ls_family'],
      ['Have a will', 'ls_family'],
    ]}
    selectedCards={["Married"]}
    cardWidth="200px"
    cardHeight="120px"
    onCardClick={() => {}}
  />
</Container>

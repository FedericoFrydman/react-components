# Button

Buttons are used to initiate an action. It contains a combination of label, and can be supplemented with an icon.
Button label should be concise and clearly describe action occurs after user’s interaction.

<ArgsTable of={Button} />

## Button Variants

There are three Button variants: `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary`. They indicate the heirachary of
actions types and relative importance in the UI. There are three former variants that have been deprecated
but are supported for now: `standard`, `link`, and `destructive`. These will be removed in a future version.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Primary Button

---

**Primary button** calls attention to important actions. Use them to emphasize a preferred action. Not all interfaces require a primary button.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--primary" />
</Canvas>

- **Do** Limit use of Primary Button on a UI to build visual hierarchy.
- **Do** use Primary Button for submit a form or go to next step in the process.
- **Do not** use Primary Button to open external link.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Secondary Button

---

**Secondary button** are secondary buttons for lesser consequential actions, such as Edit or Cancel. Often these are placed alongside a Primary button.

A screen can contain multiple secondary buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--secondary" />
</Canvas>

- **Do not** use Secondary Button to open external link

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Tertiary button

---

**Tertiary Button** is used to navigate to another page and should open in the current window unless:

- Information may be lost, e.g. when someone is filling out a form
- The destination is an external site, e.g. for a knowledge base article

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--tertiary" />
</Canvas>

- **Do** use Tertiary button for navigational action, such as “Back” or “Next”

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Destructive Buttons

A Destructive button indicates in the UI that the associated action will delete or remove a relevant item.
When the `destructive` prop is `true`, the button will turn red to indiciate that action type. This can be used with any of the button variants.

### Primary

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--primary-destructive" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--secondary-destructive" />
</Canvas>

### Tertiary

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--tertiary-destructive" />
</Canvas>

## Icon Buttons

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Icon-only Button

---

**Icon only Button** is a standalone button without any visible text label. Extra care is needed when choosing an icon making sure it is well understood and follow common convention (example: magnify glass for search, person icon for user, trash for delete). This button type is often used to trigger an overflow menu on mobile.

Alt text and other accessibility considerations need to be included to make sure this button makes sense to all users.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--icon-button" />
</Canvas>

- **Do** include alt text so user can hover and understand
- **Do** follow common well-known convention when choosing an icon

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Button with Icon

Buttons can have one or two icons, which can present on the left and/or right side of the button.

#### Left Side

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-icon-left" />
</Canvas>

#### Right Side

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-icon-right" />
</Canvas>

#### Custom Color

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-colored-icon-left" />
</Canvas>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Stretch Button

---

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-button--stretch" />
</Canvas>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Button with an icon

---

These is how the btn looks with the icon

- To the **left**
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-icon-left" />
  </Canvas>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
- To the **right**
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-icon-right" />
  </Canvas>
- To the **left with color**
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="controls-button--btn-w-colored-icon-left" />
  </Canvas>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## General Usage

- Use only one primary button per screen
- Always place buttons in easy-to-spot locations
- Avoid modifying or disabling interactive states
- Where possible, make system actions like copying links and opening in new tabs available
- When pairing Primary and Standard buttons together such as “Send” and “Cancel”, our buttons are right aligned and Primary button should be the farthest right in the group.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

## Label Considerations

- Write the label in concise, clear terms so that users know what will happen if they click.
- Use title case in the button text.
- Aim for a low character count (four words or fewer).
- Check for text legibility and sufficient contrast when using transparent button styles.
